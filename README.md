# [WIP] Rollup React App
Boilerplate to create a React app using Rollup.

## Why
- Create a minimal from scratch React app using Rollup for bundle but also for developement instead of Webpack
- No complete boilerplate / example how to bundle/dev React app using Rollup
- Stay compatible with react-app commands (start, build, test)
- Conform to good practices (Husky, Commitlint, ...)
- Experiment new stuff (Nollup, Typescript)

## TODO
- [x] Base code
- [x] Serve
- [x] Jsx support
- [x] Build for prod
- [x] Css / images
- [ ] Hot reload
- [ ] Typescript
- [ ] esm/iife scripts support
- [ ] test

## Available Scripts

RRA tries to work as react-app, so commands are the same.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn test`

# [WIP] Rollup React App
Boilerplate to create a React app using Rollup.

## Why
- Create a minimal from scratch React app using Rollup instead of Webpack
- Stay compatible with react-app commands (start, build, test)
- Conform to good practices (Hsuky, Commitlint, ...)

## TODO
- [x] Base code
- [x] Serve
- [x] Jsx support
- [x] Build for prod
- [ ] Css / images
- [ ] Hot reload
- [ ] Typescript
- [ ] esm/iife scripts support
- [ ] test
